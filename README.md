Personal Website Project will test and show what I've learned about the technologies I studied at Deep Dive.

## Milestone I 
  Good job on Milestone 1. The scope of work you outlined in your Purpose, Audience, and Goal matches the guidelines in the project specifications. The Persona clearly describes your target demographic. Finally, your HTML is structured in a clean format.
### Edits and Suggestions
  I am disappointed with the quality of content for the persona section. Goals and frustrations seem rushed and muddled, and you also skipped the user story.
* The goals section in the persona should outline what Sandy hopes to accomplish using your site.
  * Example: Sandy hopes to be able to view potential businesses/contractors portfolio's to narrow down her list of service providers.
* frustrations in the Persona section should highlight Sandy's frustrations finding a contractor/business to create her site.
  * Example: Sandy has had a hard time finding the portfolios of potential contractors/businesses she is looking to hire and will longer consider a service-provider whose portfolio is not easily accessible.

### Grade Tier III


### Milestone 2a Feedback
Good work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear but my only suggestion here would be to have more detail when it comes to defining the target audience. Other than that, your content strategy will be a good influence on your design.

For your portfolio section, you might want to stack these items on the smallest screens to ensure there is enough space to comfortably see every image. I also think you'll want to fix that line about "Here is a link to my projects I have been working on..." Maybe shorten it up. It'll help take away some of that clutter and give it a cleaner look.

You could also consider interactive gallery functionality like [FancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/).

Additional recommendations:
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a good quality free library for including iconography.

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Keep it up!
