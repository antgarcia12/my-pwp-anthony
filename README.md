Personal Website Project will test and show what I've learned about the technologies I studied at Deep Dive.

## Milestone I 
  Good job on Milestone 1. The scope of work you outlined in your Purpose, Audience, and Goal matches the guidelines in the project specifications. The Persona clearly describes your target demographic. Finally, your HTML is structured in a clean format.
### Edits and Suggestions
  I am disappointed with the quality of content for the persona section. Goals and frustrations seem rushed and muddled, and you also skipped the user story.
* The goals section in the persona should outline what Sandy hopes to accomplish using your site.
  * Example: Sandy hopes to be able to view potential businesses/contractors portfolio's to narrow down her list of service providers.
* frustrations in the Persona section should highlight Sandy's frustrations finding a contractor/business to create her site.
  * Example: Sandy has had a hard time finding the portfolios of potential contractors/businesses she is looking to hire and will longer consider a service-provider whose portfolio is not easily accessible.
