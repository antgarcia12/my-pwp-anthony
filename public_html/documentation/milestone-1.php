		<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>
		<h3>Purpose: </h3>
			<p>The purpose of my personal website is to showcase the technologies I've learned at Deep Dive to begin my way into the local business scene that Albuquerque has to offer.</p>
		<h3>Audience: </h3>
			<p>The audience that I plan to reach out to would be mainly clients that have local or start up businesses, especially the clients that are trying to put themselves out there any way they can, and in my case that would be a website I create for them.</p>
		<h3>Goal: </h3>
			<p>In the end, my goal is to attract freelance clients, from a wide range of local business, of any type, that could potentially be lasting partnerships.</p>

She has the advantage as her father once held a house flipping business when he was younger. One thing that her father wanted to make her aware of was that we live in a very technological era, where everything we look for can be found on the internet. Sandy has the advantage of the internet, as her father didn't have access to such a useful tool when he was younger. It begins to frustrate Sandy because she doesn't know where to begin to promote her business, besides getting in </p>
