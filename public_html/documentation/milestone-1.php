		<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h1>
		<h3>Purpose: </h3>
			<p>The purpose of my personal website is to showcase the technologies I've learned at Deep Dive to begin my way into the local business scene that Albuquerque has to offer.</p>
		<h3>Audience: </h3>
			<p>The audience that I plan to reach out to would be mainly clients that have local or start up businesses, especially the clients that are trying to put themselves out there any way they can, and in my case that would be a website I create for them.</p>
		<h3>Goal: </h3>
			<p>In the end, my goal is to attract freelance clients, from a wide range of local business, of any type, that could potentially be lasting partnerships.</p>
		<h1>Persona</h1>
			<p><strong>Name: </strong>Sandy Sanchez</p>
			<p><strong>Age: </strong>30 years old</p>
			<p><strong>Job:</strong>Nursing, RN</p>
			<p><strong>Technology: </strong><em>Computer- </em>HP EliteBook x360 1020 Laptop OS: Windows 10 Pro <em>Phone- </em> iPhone X with iOS 12</p>
			<p><strong>Attitude: </strong>Sandy is a passionate nurse, enjoying what she does everyday, taking care of people on a daily basis. Recently, Sandy had been discussing with her father about a new venture into the house flipping business, as she has the money to do so. Sandy is certainly enthusiastic on what could become of this new challenge.</p>
			<p><strong>Behavior:</strong>Sandy understand that the task of starting the business is going to be tough, especially trying to do so as nurse, but she loves to multitask. She has the advantage as her father once held a house flipping business when he was younger. One thing that her father wanted to make her aware of was that we live in a very technological era, where everything we look for can be found on the internet. Sandy has the advantage of the internet, as her father didn't have access to such a useful tool when he was younger. It begins to frustrate Sandy because she doesn't know where to begin to promote her business, besides getting in contact with people. She rather show people that her family has experience in flipping houses rather than explaining over email, phone, or in person with the chance of getting no business, as time is very crucial in her life.</p>
			<p><strong>Goal: </strong>Sandy wants the goal of creating a website that shows the necessary information for a client to decide whether or not they want her business. She stumbles upon my website and reads that I create websites with the idea of helping local businesses start up or expand on their mission statements.</p>
